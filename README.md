# CSE444 Lab 5: Query Optimization

### Due: Thursday, June 12th, 2025 (hard deadline, no late days allowed)

### Project Guidelines: This lab includes a final project report summarizing your work on SimpleDB. Instead of a separate writeup document, put your answers to the exercise questions in section 1 of the final report document. See the final project instructions [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/25sp/content/Project.html)  for details.

##### For Spring 2025: This quarter we will only require the first half of the lab 5 requirements, plus the final project report. You only need to complete the spec through the end of section 2.2.4 (and put the answers to exercises 1 through 4 in your writeup). This means you don't need to pass the QueryTest systemtest or the orderJoinsTest in JoinOptimizerTest.java. You do need to pass the rest of the unit tests described below until section 2.3.

In this lab, you will implement a query optimizer on top of SimpleDB. The main tasks include implementing a selectivity estimation framework and a cost-based optimizer. You have freedom as to exactly what you implement, but we recommend using something similar to the Selinger cost-based optimizer discussed in class.

The remainder of this document describes what is involved in adding optimizer support and provides a basic outline of how you might add this support to your database.

As with the previous lab, we recommend that you start as early as possible.

## 1. Getting started

This lab is not dependent on your implementation of Lab 3 or Lab 4. You may begin with your lab 4 code, but if you wish you can also revert to your lab 2 code before pulling the lab 5 contents.

You will need to add these new files to your release. You will do this by performing a `git` pull from the upstream repository that you configured during the previous lab.  

```
$ git pull upstream lab5
```

### 1.1. Implementation hints

We suggest exercises along this document to guide your implementation, but you may find that a different order makes more sense for you. As before, we will grade your assignment by looking at your code and verifying that you have passed the test for the ant targets `test` and `systemtest`. (See the top of the document for exceptions for spring 2025.)

Here's a rough outline of one way you might proceed with this lab. More details on these steps are given in Section 2 below.

*   Implement the methods in the `TableStats` class that allow it to estimate selectivities of filters and cost of scans, using histograms (skeleton provided for the 'IntHistogram' class) or some other form of statistics of your devising.
*   Implement the methods in the `JoinOptimizer` class that allow it to estimate the cost and selectivities of joins.
*   Write the `orderJoins` method in `JoinOptimizer`. This method must produce an optimal ordering for a series of joins (likely using dynamic programming), given statistics computed in the previous two steps.

## 2. Optimizer outline

Recall that the main idea of a cost-based optimizer is to:

*   Use statistics about tables to estimate "costs" of different query plans. Typically, the cost of a plan is related to the cardinalities of (number of tuples produced by) intermediate joins and selections, as well as the selectivity of filter and join predicates.
*   Use these statistics to order joins and selections in an optimal way, and to select the best implementation for join algorithms from amongst several alternatives.

In this lab, you will implement code to perform both of these functions.

The optimizer will be invoked from `simpledb/Parser.java`. You may wish to review the [lab 2 parser exercise](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse444-25sp/simple-db/blob/lab2/README.md) before starting this lab. Briefly, if you have a catalog file `catalog.txt` describing your tables, you can run the parser by typing:

```
java -jar dist/simpledb.jar parser catalog.txt
```

When the Parser is invoked, it will compute statistics over all of the tables (using statistics code you provide). When a query is issued, the parser will convert the query into a logical plan representation and then call your query optimizer to generate an optimal plan.

### 2.1 Overall Optimizer Structure

Before getting started with the implementation, you need to understand the overall structure of the SimpleDB optimizer.

The overall control flow of the SimpleDB modules of the parser and optimizer is shown in Figure 1.

![](controlflow.png)

Figure 1: Diagram illustrating classes, methods, and objects used in the parser and optimizer.

The key at the bottom explains the symbols; you will implement the components with double-borders. The classes and methods will be explained in more detail in the text that follows (you may wish to refer back to this diagram), but the basic operation is as follows:

1.  `Parser.java` constructs a set of table statistics (stored in the `statsMap` container) when it is initialized. It then waits for a query to be input, and calls the method `parseQuery` on that query.
2.  `parseQuery` first constructs a `LogicalPlan` that represents the parsed query. `parseQuery` then calls the method `physicalPlan` on the `LogicalPlan` instance it has constructed. The `physicalPlan` method returns a `DBIterator` object that can be used to actually run the query.

In the exercises to come, you will implement the methods that help `physicalPlan` devise an optimal plan.

**Exercise 1: Parser.java**

(You don't need to implement any methods for the Parser, but in this exercise you will describe what happens to a query in SimpleDB. Put the answers to the exercise in your project report as described at the top of the README.)

When you launch SimpleDB, the entry point of the application is simpledb.Parser.main(). 

Starting from that entry point, describe the life of a query from its submission by the user to its execution. For this, list the sequence of methods that are invoked. For each method, describe its primary functions. When you describe the methods that build the physical query plan, **discuss how the plan is built**. Write the answers in your lab 5 writeup document.

To help you, we provide the description of the first few methods. In general, however, it is up to you to decide on the appropriate level of detail for your description. Keep in mind that the goal is to demonstrate your understanding of the _optimizer_.

**Life of a query in SimpleDB**

**Step 1: simpledb.Parser.main() and simpledb.Parser.start()**

`simpledb.Parser.main()` is the entry point for the SimpleDB system. It calls `simpledb.Parser.start()`. The latter performs three main actions:

*   It populates the SimpleDB catalog from the catalog text file provided by the user as argument (`Database.getCatalog().loadSchema(argv[0]);`).
*   For each table defined in the system catalog, it computes statistics over the data in the table by calling: `TableStats.computeStatistics()`, which then does: `TableStats s = new TableStats(tableid, IOCOSTPERPAGE);`
*   It processes the statements submitted by the user `(processNextStatement(new ByteArrayInputStream(statementBytes));)`

**Step 2: simpledb.Parser.processNextStatement()**

This method takes two key actions:

*   First, it gets a physical plan for the query by invoking `handleQueryStatement((ZQuery)s);`
*   Then it executes the query by calling `query.execute();`

**Step 3: simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement()**

.... please continue describing the life of the query in the SimpleDB system....

Remember to describe the key steps involved in the construction of the physical query plan. 

### 2.2. Statistics Estimation

Accurately estimating plan cost is quite tricky. In this lab, we will focus only on the cost of sequences of joins and base table accesses. We won't worry about access method selection (since we only have one access method, table scans) or the costs of additional operators (like aggregates). You are only required to consider left-deep plans for this lab although we provide methods that will help you search through a larger variety of plans, which is the set of all _linear_ plans. With linear plans, the relation on one side of each operator is always a base relation but it can appear either as the outer or inner relation. See Section 2.3 for a description of additional "bonus" optimizer features you might implement, including an approach for handling bushy plans.

#### 2.2.1 Overall Plan Cost

We will write join plans of the form `p=t1 join t2 join ... tn` , which signifies a left deep join where t1 is the left-most join (deepest in the tree). Given a plan like `p`, its cost can be expressed as:

```
scancost(t1) + scancost(t2) + joincost(t1 join t2) +
scancost(t3) + joincost((t1 join t2) join t3) +
...
```

Here, `scancost(t1)` is the I/O cost of scanning table t1, `joincost(t1,t2)` is the CPU cost to join t1 to t2\. To make I/O and CPU cost comparable, typically a constant scaling factor is used, e.g.:

```
cost(predicate application) = 1
cost(pageScan) = SCALING_FACTOR x cost(predicate application)
```

For this lab, you can ignore the effects of caching (e.g., assume that every access to a table incurs the full cost of a scan) -- again, this is something you may add as an optional bonus extension to your lab in Section 2.3\. Therefore, `scancost(t1)` is simply the number of pages in `t1 x SCALING_FACTOR`.

#### 2.2.2 Join Cost

When using nested loops joins, recall that the cost of a join between two tables t1 and t2 (where t1 is the outer) is simply:

```
joincost(t1 join t2) = scancost(t1) + ntups(t1) x scancost(t2) //IO cost
                       + ntups(t1) x ntups(t2)  //CPU cost
```

Here, `ntups(t1)` is the number of tuples in table t1.

#### 2.2.3 Filter Selectivity

`ntups` can be directly computed for a base table by scanning that table.
Estimating `ntups` for a table with one or more selection predicates over it can be trickier -- this is the _filter selectivity estimation_ problem. Here's one approach that you should use, based on computing a histogram over the values in the table:

*   Compute the minimum and maximum values for every attribute in the table (by scanning it once).

*   Construct a histogram for every attribute in the table. A simple approach (and the approach you should use) is to use a fixed number of buckets _NumB_, with each bucket representing the number of records in a fixed range of the domain of the attribute of the histogram. For example, if a field 'f' ranges from 1 to 100, and there are 10 buckets, then bucket 1 might contain the count of the number of records between 1 and 10, bucket 2 a count of the number of records between 11 and 20, and so on. For simplicity, you should put any overflow into the last bucket. For example, if instead 'f' ranged from 1 to 103, the last bucket would contain 13 elements, from 91 to 103 inclusive.

*   Scan the table again, selecting out all of fields of all of the tuples and using them to populate the counts of the buckets in each histogram.

*   To estimate the selectivity of an equality expression, `f=const`, compute the bucket that contains value `const`. Suppose the width (range of values) of the bucket is `w`, the height (number of tuples) is `h`, and the number of tuples in the table is `ntups`. Then, assuming values are uniformly distributed throughout the bucket, the selectivity of the expression is roughly `(h / w) / ntups` , since `(h/w)` represents the expected number of tuples in the bin with value `const`.

*   To estimate the selectivity of a range expression `f>const`, compute the bucket `b` that `const` is in, with width `w_b` and height `h_b`. Then, `b` contains a fraction `b_f = h_b / ntups` of the total tuples. Assuming tuples are uniformly distributed throughout `b`, the fraction `b_part` of `b` that is `> const` is `(b_right - const) / w_b`, where `b_right` is the right endpoint of `b`'s bucket. Thus, bucket `b` contributes `(b_f x b_part)` selectivity to the predicate. In addition, buckets `b+1...NumB-1` contribute all of their selectivity (which can be computed using a formula similar to `b_f` above). Summing the selectivity contributions of all the buckets will yield the overall selectivity of the expression. Figure 2 illustrates this process.

*   Selectivity of expressions involving `less than` can be performed similar to the greater than case, looking at buckets down to 0.

* 	Make sure you also consider outliers. For example, if `f=const` has a `const` outside the domain, the selectivity should be 0. If `f>const` or `f<const` results in selecting all tuples, then you can simply return `1`.  

![](lab5-hist.png)

Figure 2: Diagram illustrating the histograms you will implement in Lab 5.

In the next two exercises, you will code to perform selectivity estimation of joins and filters.

**Exercise 2: IntHistogram.java**

You will need to implement some way to record table statistics for selectivity estimation. We have provided a skeleton class, `IntHistogram` that will do this. We have also provided a class `StringHistogram` that uses `IntHistogram` to compute selectivities for String predicates. You may modify `StringHistogram` if you want to implement a better estimator, though you should not need to in order to complete this lab.

After completing this exercise, you should be able to pass the `IntHistogramTest` unit test.

**Exercise 3: TableStats.java**

The class `TableStats` contains methods that compute the number of tuples and pages in a table and that estimate the selectivity of predicates over the fields of that table. The query parser we have created creates one instance of `TableStats` per table, and passes these structures into your query optimizer (which you will need in later exercises).

You should fill in the following methods and classes in `TableStats`:

*   Implement the `TableStats` constructor: Once you have implemented histograms, you should implement the `TableStats` constructor, adding code to scan the table (possibly multiple times) to build the statistics you need.

*   Implement `estimateSelectivity(int field, Predicate.Op op, Field constant)`: Using your statistics (e.g., an `IntHistogram` or `StringHistogram` depending on the type of the field), estimate the selectivity of predicate `field op constant` on the table.

*   Implement `estimateScanCost()`: This method estimates the cost of sequentially scanning the file, given that the cost to read a page is `costPerPageIO`. You can assume that there are no seeks and that no pages are in the buffer pool. This method may use costs or sizes you computed in the constructor.

*   Implement `estimateTableCardinality(double selectivityFactor)`: This method returns the number of tuples in the relation, given that a predicate with selectivity selectivityFactor is applied. This method may use costs or sizes you computed in the constructor.

You may wish to modify the constructor of `TableStats.java` to, for example, compute histograms over the fields as described above for purposes of selectivity estimation.

After completing these tasks you should be able to pass the unit tests in `TableStatsTest`.

#### 2.2.4 Join Cardinality

Finally, observe that the cost for the join plan `p` above includes expressions of the form `joincost((t1 join t2) join t3)`. To evaluate this expression, you need some way to estimate the size (`ntups`) of `t1 join t2`. This `join cardinality estimation` problem is harder than the filter selectivity estimation problem. In this lab, you aren't required to do anything fancy for this, though one of the optional excercises in Section 2.5 includes two approaches for better join cardinality estimation.

While implementing, your simple solution, you should keep in mind the following:

*   For equality joins, when one of the attributes is a primary key, the number of tuples produced by the join cannot be larger than the cardinality of the non-primary key attribute.
*   For equality joins when there is no primary key, it's hard to say much about what the size of the output is -- it could be the size of the product of the cardinalities of the tables (if both tables have the same value for all tuples) -- or it could be 0\. It's fine to make up a simple heuristic (say, the size of the larger of the two tables).
*   For range scans, it is similarly hard to say anything accurate about sizes. The size of the output should be proportional to the sizes of the inputs. It is fine to assume that a fixed fraction of the cross-product is emitted by range scans (say, 30%). In general, the cost of a range join should be larger than the cost of a non-primary key equality join of two tables of the same size.

**Exercise 4: Join Cost Estimation**

The class `JoinOptimizer.java` includes all of the methods for ordering and computing costs of joins. In this exercise, you will write the methods for estimating the selectivity and cost of a join, specifically:

*   Implement `estimateJoinCost(LogicalJoinNode j, int card1, int card2, double cost1, double cost2)`: This method estimates the cost of join `j`, given that the left input is of cardinality `card1`, the right input of cardinality `card2`, that the cost to access the left input is `cost1`, and that the cost to access the right input is `cost2`. You can assume the join is an NL `join`, and apply the formula mentioned earlier.
*   Implement `estimateJoinCardinality(LogicalJoinNode j, int card1, int card2, boolean t1pkey, boolean t2pkey)`: This method estimates the number of tuples output by join `j`, given that the left input is size `card1`, the right input is size `card2`, and the flags `t1pkey` and `t2pkey` that indicate whether the left and right (respectively) field is unique (a primary key).

After implementing these methods, you should be able to pass the unit tests in `JoinOptimizerTest.java`, other than `orderJoinsTest`.

##### For spring quarter 2025, the rest of the lab from this point on is optional. Feel free to complete it, but you only need to pass the unit tests described above to get full points on the lab.

### 2.3 Join Ordering

Now that you have implemented methods for estimating costs, you will implement a Selinger-style optimizer. For these methods, joins are expressed as a list of join nodes (e.g., predicates over two tables) as opposed to a list of relations to join as described in class.

Translating the algorithm to the join node list form mentioned above, an outline in pseudocode would be as follows.

_Hint: We discussed this algorithm in detail in class!_

```
 j = set of join nodes
 for (i in 1...|j|):  // First find best plan for single join, then for two joins, etc.
     for s in {all length i subsets of j} // Looking at a concrete subset of joins
       bestPlan = {}  // We want to find the best plan for this concrete subset
       for s' in {all length i-1 subsets of s}
            subplan = optjoin(s')   // Look-up in the cache the best query plan for s but with one relation missing
            plan = best way to join (s-s') to subplan  // Now find the best plan to extend s' by one join to get s
            if (cost(plan) < cost(bestPlan))
               bestPlan = plan // Update the best plan for computing s
       optjoin(s) = bestPlan
 return optjoin(j)
```

To help you implement this algorithm, we have provided several classes and methods to assist you. First, the method `enumerateSubsets(Vector v, int size)` in `JoinOptimizer.java` will return a set of all of the subsets of `v` of size `size`. This method is not particularly efficient; you can earn extra credit by implementing a more efficient enumerator.

Second, we have provided the method:

```
private CostCard computeCostAndCardOfSubplan(
                    HashMap<String, TableStats> stats,
                    HashMap<String, Double> filterSelectivities,
                    LogicalJoinNode joinToRemove,
                    Set<LogicalJoinNode> joinSet,
                    double bestCostSoFar,PlanCache pc)
```

Given a subset of joins (`joinSet`), and a join to remove from this set (`joinToRemove`), this method computes the best way to join `joinToRemove` to `joinSet - {joinToRemove}`. It returns this best method in a `CostCard` object, which includes the cost, cardinality, and best join ordering (as a vector). `computeCostAndCardOfSubplan` may return null, if no plan can be found (because, for example, there is no linear join that is possible), or if the cost of all plans is greater than the `bestCostSoFar` argument. The method uses a cache of previous joins called `pc` (`optjoin` in the psuedocode above) to quickly lookup the fastest way to join `joinSet - {joinToRemove}`. The other arguments (`stats` and `filterSelectivities`) are passed into the `orderJoins` method that you must implement as a part of Exercise 4, and are explained below. This method essentially performs lines 6--8 of the psuedocode described earlier.

Note: While the original Selinger optimizer considered only left-deep plans,   `computeCostAndCardOfSubplan` considers all _linear_ plans.

Third, we have provided the method:

```    
private void printJoins(Vector<LogicalJoinNode> js,
                           PlanCache pc,
                           HashMap<String, TableStats> stats,
                           HashMap<String, Double> selectivities)
```

This method can be used to display a graphical representation of the join costs/cardinalities (when the "explain" flag is set via the "-explain" option to the optimizer, for example).

Fourth, we have provided a class `PlanCache` that can be used to cache the best way to join a subset of the joins considered so far in your implementation of the Selinger-style optimizer (an instance of this class is needed to use `computeCostAndCardOfSubplan`).  

**Exercise 5: Join Ordering**

In `JoinOptimizer.java`, implement the method:

```
  Vector orderJoins(HashMap<String, TableStats> stats,
                   HashMap<String, Double> filterSelectivities,
                   boolean explain)
```

This method should operate on the `joins` class member, returning a new Vector that specifies the order in which joins should be done. Item 0 of this vector indicates the bottom-most join in a linear plan. Adjacent joins in the returned vector should share at least one field to ensure the plan is linear. Here `stats` is an object that lets you find the `TableStats` for a given table name that appears in the `FROM` list of the query. `filterSelectivities` allows you to find the selectivity of any predicates over a table; it is guaranteed to have one entry per table name in the `FROM` list. Finally, `explain` specifies that you should output a representation of the join order for informational purposes.

You may wish to use the helper methods and classes described above to assist in your implementation. Roughly, your implementation should follow the psuedocode above, looping through subset sizes, subsets, and sub-plans of subsets, calling `computeCostAndCardOfSubplan` and building a `PlanCache` object that stores the minimal-cost way to perform each subset join.

After implementing this method, you should be able to pass the test `OrderJoinsTest`. You should also pass the system test `QueryTest`.

### 2.4 Putting it all together

Now that you have a working optimizer, you can study the query plans that your optimizer generates.

In this exercise, we will use a relational database over movies. The data in this database is from the IMDB website. The database consists of six tables:

```
actor (id, fname, lname, gender)
movie (id, name, year)
director (id, fname, lname)
casts (pid, mid, role) // Indicates which actor (pid references Actor.id) played in each movie (mid references Movie.id)
movie_director (did, mid) // Indicates which director (did references Director.id) directed which movie (mid references Movie.id)
genre (mid, genre)
```

We provide you with the following:

* The schema of the IMDB database: [imdb.schema](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse444/21wi/labs/lab5/imdb.schema).
* A small 1% version of the IMDB database: [sample-0.01.tar.bz2](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse444/21wi/labs/lab5/sample-0.01.tar.bz2). This is the recommended version to use in the assignment. 
* In case your version of SimpleDB is too slow to handle the 1% dataset, we also provide 0.1% sample: [sample-0.001.tar.bz2](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse444/21wi/labs/lab5/sample-0.001.tar.bz2). 
* If you are feeling adventurous, here is the 10% version: [sample-0.1.tar.bz2](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse444/21wi/labs/lab5/sample-0.1.tar.bz2). Feel free to use it if you prefer.

The QueryPlanVisualizer will print the whole query plan for each query. If you would like to see more information about the joins, you can launch SimpleDB with the `-explain` option enabled:

```
java -classpath "bin/src/:lib/*" simpledb.Parser $IMDB_DATA_FOLDER/imdb.schema -explain   
```

**Exercise 6: Query Plans**

6.1 Execute the following query

```
select d.fname, d.lname  
from actor a, casts c, movie_director m, director d
where a.id=c.pid and c.mid=m.mid and m.did=d.id
and a.lname='Spicer';
```

In your writeup, show the query plan that your optimizer selected. Explain why your optimizer selected that plan. Be careful as the plan may be different for the 1%, 0.1%, and 10% datasets (you do not need to test with all the datasets, just pick one).

6.2 Execute another SQL query of your choice over the IMDB database.

 Show the query plan that your optimizer generates. Discuss why your optimizer generates that plan. Try to find an interesting SQL query with a combination of joins and selections.

### 2.5 Project Extensions 

In this section, we describe several possible extensions to your query optimizer. These are less well defined than the previous exercises but give you a chance to show off your mastery of query optimization!

**Make sure to develop unit-tests for verifying the correctness of your extension.** Please use JUnit when appropriate but feel free to also go beyond JUnit and use scripts if that helps you test some interesting, additional configurations. For the tests that you add, please add them to a separate directory called **test-extensions**.

1) _Add code to perform more advanced join cardinality estimation_. Rather than using simple heuristics to estimate join cardinality, devise a more sophisticated algorithm.
One option is to use joint histograms between every pair of attributes `a` and `b` in every pair of tables `t1` and `t2`. The idea is to create buckets of `a`, and for each bucket `A` of `a`, create a histogram of `b` values that co-occur with `a` values in `A`.
Another way to estimate the cardinality of a join is to assume that each value in the smaller table has a matching value in the larger table. Then the formula for the join selectivity would be: `1/(_Max_(_num-distinct_(t1, column1), _num-distinct_(t2, column2)))`. Here, `column1` and `column2` are the join attributes. The cardinality of the join is then the product of the cardinalities of `t1` and `t2` times the selectivity.  

2) _Improved subset iterator_. Our implementation of `enumerateSubsets` is quite inefficient, because it creates a large number of Java objects on each invocation. A better approach would be to implement an iterator that, for example, returns a `BitSet` that specifies the elements in the `joins` vector that should be accessed on each iteration. In this exercise, you would improve the performance of `enumerateSubsets` so that your system could perform query optimization on plans with 20 or more joins (currently such plans takes minutes or hours to compute).

3) _A cost model that accounts for caching_. The methods to estimate scan and join cost do not account for caching in the buffer pool. You should extend the cost model to account for caching effects. This is tricky because multiple joins are running simultaneously due to the iterator model, and so it may be hard to predict how much memory each will have access to using the simple buffer pool we have implemented in previous labs.

4) _Improved join algorithms and algorithm selection_. Our current cost estimation and join operator selection algorithms (see `instantiateJoin()` in `JoinOptimizer.java`) only consider nested loops joins. Extend these methods to use one or more additional join algorithms (for example, some form of in memory hashing using a `HashMap`).

5) _Bushy plans_. Improve the provided `orderJoins()` and other helper methods to generate bushy joins. Our query plan generation and visualization algorithms are perfectly capable of handling bushy plans; for example, if `orderJoins()` returns the vector `(t1 join t2 ; t3 join t4 ; t2 join t3)`, this will correspond to a bushy plan with the `(t2 join t3)` node at the top.


You have now completed this lab. Good work!

## 3\. Logistics


### 3.1\. Submitting your assignment


You may submit your code multiple times; we will use the latest version you submit that arrives before the deadline. Place the project report called `lab5-writeup.pdf` in the top level of your repository. This should be your final project report, with lab 5 questions contained within section 1.

See here for more details about the format of the `lab5-write.pdf` document:
https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/25sp/content/Project.html

**Important**: In order for your writeup to be added to the git repo, you need to explicitly add it:

```sh
$ git add lab5-writeup.pdf
```

You also need to explicitly add any other files you create, such as new `*.java` files.

The criteria for your lab being submitted on time is that your code must be tagged and pushed by the due date and time. This means that if one of the TAs or the instructor were to open up GitLab, they would be able to see your solutions on the GitLab web page.

**Just because your code has been committed on your local machine does not mean that it has been submitted -- it needs to be on GitLab!**

There is a bash script `turnInLab.sh` in the root level directory of your repository that commits your changes, deletes any prior tag for the current lab, tags the current commit, and pushes the branch and tag to GitLab. If you are using Linux or Mac OSX, you should be able to run the following:

```sh
$ ./turnInLab.sh lab5
```

You should see something like the following output:

```sh
$ ./turnInLab.sh lab5

### 3.2\. Submitting a bug

SimpleDB is a relatively complex piece of code. It is very possible you are going to find bugs, inconsistencies, and bad, outdated, or incorrect documentation, etc.

We ask you, therefore, to do this lab with an adventurous mindset. Don't get mad if something is not clear, or even wrong; rather, try to figure it out yourself or send us a friendly email. Please create (friendly!) issues reports on the repository website. When you do, please try to include:

*   A description of the bug.
*   A `.java` file we can drop in the `test/simpledb` directory, compile, and run.
*   A `.txt` file with the data that reproduces the bug. We should be able to convert it to a `.dat` file using `HeapFileEncoder`.

You can also post on the class message board if you feel you have run into a bug.

### 3.3 Grading

**Important:** Before testing, we will replace your `build.xml`, `HeapFileEncoder.java`, and the entire contents of the `test/` directory with our version of these files! This means you cannot change the format of `.dat` files! You should therefore be careful changing our APIs. This also means you need to test whether your code compiles with our test programs. In other words, during the grading process we will clone your repository, replace the files mentioned above, compile it, and then grade it. It will look roughly like this:

```sh
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:cse444-25sp/simple-db-yourname
$ # [replace build.xml and test]
$ git checkout -- build.xml test\
$ ant test
$ ant systemtest
$ # [additional tests]
```
